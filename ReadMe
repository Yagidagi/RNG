Setup (This is run on Java):

git clone git@github.com:Yagidagi/RNG
cd RNG
make 

Directions for use:

make run ARGS="break [7,6,8,4,12,9,2,3,1,5,10,0,7]"
    You can enter any sequence of numbers in the brackets, but in this format. This finds M, A and B
make run ARGS="Show 16"
    You can enter any integer. This lists all combinations of A and B for M=16
make run ARGS="Showunique 16"
    You can enter any integer. This lists all combinations of A and B for M=16 that cycles through all numbers of the mod
make run ARGS="int"
    You get random integer from 0 to 7 inclusive. (This has to generate a random number at some point)
    This uses the time in milliseconds as a seed
